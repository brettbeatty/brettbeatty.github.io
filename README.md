# Brett Beatty's Dev Blog

Every once in a while I get the itch to write, so I set this up as a place to do that.

I tried a couple different static site generators in the past but didn't find one I loved. I also wanted one that would support `.livemd` files so I could host livebooks, and I realized ExDoc is great at rendering `.md` and `.livemd` files and is familiar to me, so I'm giving it a try here.
